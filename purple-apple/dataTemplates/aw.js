It's all part of our commitment to serve you food you can feel good about. For us, great burgers come first. So it's only natural that we're the first and only national burger restaurant in Canada to serve beef raised without the use of hormones or steroids. We're also the first and only national burger restaurant in Canada to serve chicken raised without the use of antibiotics. Our eggs are farmed right here in Canada, from hens fed a vegetarian diet without animal by-products. We're also proud to serve organic, Fairtrade coffee blended for us by Master Roaster Van Houtte.",
